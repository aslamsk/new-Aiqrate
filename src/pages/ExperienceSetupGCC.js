                GCCs are using experience centers as innovation hubs to not only
                foster disruption in their business arenas but to also promote
                thought leadership and build strategic relationships. The AI
                experience Centre is a great experiential mechanism to exhibit
                to key stakeholders: clients, investors and end users on the
                efficacy of the AI use cases. This further accelerates the
                adoption process in the enterprise.
